* Description
This script creates an interactive shell to run common commands on servers using
ansible.

* Dependencies
- =ansible=
- =ssh=

* Installation
Clone the repository somewhere and add =main.py= into your path (ie: =ln -s
$(PWD)/make.py ~/.local/bin/ansible_helper=)
- [ ] TODO: rename modules
- [ ] TODO: have a proper setup.py

* Configuration
Copy =config_sample.py= to =config.py= in your ansible project.

You also need to configure your ansible hosts and their specific SSH options.

** Using a jumphost
If for example some hosts are not available publicly and you need to go through
a jumphost to connect to it, configure your `hosts.yml` accordingly.

For example:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
all:
  hosts:
    public:
      ansible_host: 192.168.10.10
    private:
      ansible_ssh_extra_args: -o "ProxyJump=192.168.10.10"
#+END_SRC

* Usage
Start the CLI using =python make.py=. Commands have a basic autocomplete and
shows suggestions.

Here is a summary of the available commands:
- =help=: show possible commands
- switch environment: =env nameofenv= . *NOTE*: =env= is just a filter for
  ansible hosts. For example for  =srv1:web:prod= you could use any part or all
  of it to match an environment.
- list hosts configured for the current environment: =hosts=
- list hosts impacted by an action: =list someactionname=
- ssh into a host: =ssh nameofhost=
- show logs: =logs someservicename=. =someservicename= is defined in the
  configuration and will remotely call whatever command you want to run (ie:
  =journalctl -f=

** Pass limits to commands
it is possible to narrow down hosts selected when running an action/check, using
=someactionname somehost=
